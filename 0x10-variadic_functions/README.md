### 0x10-variadic_functions

/* Variadic functions
Variadic functions are functions in programming languages that can accept a variable number of arguments. This means that the function can be called with any number of arguments, including zero, one, two, or more.

In programming, varargs or variadic functions are often defined using ellipses (...) after the function name and before the parameter list.  */
